# Google-search-using-voice
This is basically a python programme where a voice assistant will ask you for what you want to search for in the internet.
I have used the pyttsx3 library for the voice support and the googlesearch library for searching the web.
The pause is set to 3. Decreasing the value to 2 or less will make the search faster but may also get your ip blocked from google.
